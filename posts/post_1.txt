My heart is broken and I guess it has been for a while. And maybe it's tiredness, maybe it's finals stress, but I really, really, really wish that we could talk to each other and hadn't just been awkwardly ignoring each other for the whole semester. I also hope you're doing okay, hope you don't still hurt whenever I walk into the room, hope you still mean what you said when you said you didn't want me out of your life forever. Hope is good, I guess.
